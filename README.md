"I'm a cybersecurity Msc student at ETHZ and EPFL.
I like playing around with stuff, learning new stuff but what I enjoy the most is breaking stuff.
I easily get inspired by things. Sometimes I waste a lot of time but often I make some fun discoveries.
Some of my favorite interests include networking, reverse engineering, web exploitation and forensics. I also have some experience with RF and hardware security (NFC, WIFI, GPS, etc. using the HackRF One, Flipper Zero, Arduinos, Raspberry PIs, ESP32 and more).
I also enjoy taking part in CTFs (Capture The Flag), I've competed on my own as "Turing-04" and now "Enigmatix" but also with swiss teams Polygl0ts and Flagbot. I still have a lot to learn however and it's always fun to take part in new competitions to learn new things."
